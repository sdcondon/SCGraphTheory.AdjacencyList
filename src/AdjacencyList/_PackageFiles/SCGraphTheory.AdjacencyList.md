Mutable adjacency list graph implementation that implements the interfaces defined in the [SCGraphTheory.Abstractions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SCGraphTheory.Abstractions) package, and can thus work with other packages that also use this abstraction - such as [SCGraphTheory.Search](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SCGraphTheory.Search).
